# Overdrive Engine
Personal video game engine developed during my university studies with the aim of applying the knowledge obtained and learning about the structure of engines. 
Basis for the **Overdrive Collider Generator** tool, which performs Volumetric Hierarchical Approximate Convex Decomposition (**V-HACD**), based on the algorithm created by Khalled Mamou (https://github.com/kmammou/v-hacd)
